# Leetmetric
LeetMetric is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that visualizes LeetCode user statistics. It fetches real-time data using LeetCode’s GraphQL API and displays progress for Easy, Medium, and Hard problems. For development, a temporary CORS proxy is required to enable client-side API access.
